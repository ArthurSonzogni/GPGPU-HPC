# GPGPU-HPC
Some experiments for a school project with @Eusmilis.

It is the parallelization of [boids](http://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Boids)

We use these tools for
* Cuda
* OpenMP
* MPI

There is nothing interesting here, its is just a class project. But you can find interesting example and cmake files.
